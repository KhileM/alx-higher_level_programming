Python provides two built-in data structures for storing collections of items: lists and tuples.

Lists:
- Lists are ordered collections of items enclosed in square brackets `[]`.
- They are mutable, which means you can add, remove, or modify elements after creating a list.
- Lists can contain elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and even other lists.
- Elements in a list are accessed using zero-based indexing.
- Lists support various operations such as appending, concatenating, slicing, and sorting.

Tuples:
- Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified after creation.
- They are represented using parentheses `()`.
- Tuples can contain elements of different data types, just like lists.
- Elements in a tuple are accessed using zero-based indexing, similar to lists.
- Tuples are commonly used when you want to store a collection of related values that should not be modified.

Both lists and tuples are useful for organizing and manipulating data. Lists are suitable when you need to modify the collection, while tuples are preferred when you want to ensure the integrity of the data and prevent accidental modifications.
