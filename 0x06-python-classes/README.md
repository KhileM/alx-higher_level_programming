Python - Classes and Objects:

Classes and objects are core concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). In Python, classes are used to define the structure, behavior, and attributes of objects. An object is an instance of a class, which represents a specific entity or data.

A class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It encapsulates related data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data. The attributes are variables that hold data, while the methods are functions that define the behavior of the objects.

To create an object, you instantiate a class by calling its constructor. The constructor, typically named __init__, initializes the object's attributes. You can then access the object's attributes and invoke its methods using the dot notation.

Python supports the concepts of class inheritance and polymorphism. Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from parent classes, promoting code reuse and creating a hierarchical relationship between classes. Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class, facilitating code flexibility and extensibility.

Classes and objects provide a powerful mechanism for organizing and structuring code, promoting modularity, and modeling real-world entities or concepts. They help in writing maintainable, reusable, and scalable code by promoting separation of concerns and encapsulation of data and behavior.
