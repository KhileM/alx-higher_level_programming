In Python, the phrase "everything is an object" is a fundamental concept that highlights the object-oriented nature of the language. It means that every value in Python is represented by an object, and every object has a type (or class) that defines its behavior and properties.

In Python, you can create objects from built-in types like integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples. Additionally, you can create your own objects by defining classes, which are blueprints for creating instances (objects) with specific properties and methods.

Since everything is an object in Python, objects have certain characteristics and capabilities. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to functions, returned from functions, stored in data structures like lists and dictionaries, and even modified dynamically at runtime.

Understanding that everything is an object in Python is important because it allows you to leverage the language's object-oriented features effectively. You can take advantage of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and other object-oriented principles to build modular and reusable code.
