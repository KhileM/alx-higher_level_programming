Sets:

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.
Sets are defined using curly braces {} or the set() constructor.
Duplicate elements are automatically removed, and the order of elements is not guaranteed.
Sets are useful when you need to store a collection of unique values or perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
Dictionaries:

A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {} and key-value pairs separated by colons :.
Each key in a dictionary must be unique, and it is used to access its associated value.
The values in a dictionary can be of any data type.
Dictionaries provide fast and efficient lookup based on keys.
You can add, update, or remove key-value pairs in a dictionary.
