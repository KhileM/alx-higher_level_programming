SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific programming language used by software engineers to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is designed to interact with databases to perform tasks such as querying data, inserting, updating, and deleting records, creating and modifying database schemas, and defining relationships between data tables. SQL allows software engineers to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently, making it a fundamental tool for developing applications that require data storage and retrieval capabilities.
