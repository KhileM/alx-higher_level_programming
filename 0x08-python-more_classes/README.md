In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have. A class serves as a reusable structure that encapsulates related data and functionality.

An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that is created based on the class definition. Each object created from a class has its own unique set of data values for the class attributes, allowing objects to have individual states. Objects can also execute the methods defined in the class, which define their behaviors and actions.

To summarize:
- A class is a template or blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects.
- An object is an instance of a class that has its own unique state and can perform actions defined by the class methods.

Classes and objects provide a way to organize and model real-world entities or abstract concepts in code. They facilitate code reusability, encapsulation, and modular design, enabling developers to create complex systems by building upon well-defined and reusable classes.
