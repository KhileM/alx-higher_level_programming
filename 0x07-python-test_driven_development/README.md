Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. In Python, TDD is commonly practiced to ensure the quality and correctness of the code being developed.

The TDD process typically follows these steps:

1. Write a test: Start by writing a test case that defines the desired behavior of a particular piece of functionality. The test should fail initially since the functionality is not yet implemented.

2. Run the test: Execute the test and verify that it fails, as expected. This confirms that the test is correctly checking for the desired behavior.

3. Write the code: Implement the functionality that the test is targeting. The goal is to write the minimal code necessary to make the test pass.

4. Run all tests: Execute all previously written tests, including the newly added test. This ensures that the newly implemented code did not break any existing functionality.

5. Refactor: If all tests pass, you can refactor the code to improve its design, performance, or readability. The existing tests act as a safety net, allowing you to make changes confidently.

6. Repeat: Repeat the cycle by writing a new test for the next desired functionality or modifying an existing test to capture new requirements. Then, proceed with implementing and testing the code.

The key principles behind TDD are:

- Tests as specifications: Tests serve as a specification or documentation for how the code should behave. They provide a clear understanding of the expected outcomes.

- Incremental development: Code is developed in small, incremental steps. Each step introduces new functionality and is validated by passing tests.

- Fast feedback loop: TDD promotes rapid feedback on code changes. Tests are executed frequently to ensure the code remains functional.

- Regression testing: All tests are run regularly to catch any regressions or unintended side effects caused by code changes.

By following TDD practices, developers can build reliable, maintainable, and tested code. It helps in identifying issues early, encourages modular and loosely coupled code, and provides confidence in the correctness of the system.
