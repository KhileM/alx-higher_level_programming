In Python, input/output (I/O) operations are used for reading input from a user or a file and writing output to the console or a file. Python provides several built-in functions and modules to facilitate I/O operations.

Standard Input and Output:
input(): Reads a line of input from the user as a string. It prompts the user to enter data and waits for input until the user presses the Enter key. The input is typically assigned to a variable for further processing.
print(): Outputs text or variable values to the console. It accepts one or more arguments and displays them as a formatted string. By default, print() adds a newline character at the end of the output.

File I/O:
open(): Opens a file and returns a file object. It takes a filename and an optional mode parameter (e.g., "r" for reading, "w" for writing, "a" for appending, etc.).
File object methods:
read(): Reads the entire contents of a file as a string or a specified number of bytes.
readline(): Reads a single line from the file.
write(): Writes a string or bytes to the file.
close(): Closes the file, releasing system resources.

Standard Streams:
sys.stdin: Standard input stream used by input(). It can be used for reading input from alternative sources.
sys.stdout: Standard output stream used by print(). It can be redirected to write output to a file or another destination.
sys.stderr: Standard error stream used for displaying error messages.

These are the basic concepts of input/output in Python. Python also provides more advanced I/O operations, such as reading/writing binary files, working with CSV or JSON data, and using specialized modules like csv, json, or third-party libraries for more complex I/O tasks.
