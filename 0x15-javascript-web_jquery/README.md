jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library designed to simplify client-side scripting in HTML. It provides an easy-to-use API that allows developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, create animations, and make asynchronous HTTP requests, among other tasks. jQuery abstracts many of the complexities of JavaScript and provides a more streamlined and cross-browser compatible way to interact with web pages. It was widely used in web development to create dynamic and interactive websites. However, with the advancement of modern web technologies, the usage of jQuery has decreased, and developers now tend to use native JavaScript or modern front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
