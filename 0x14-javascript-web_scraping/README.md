JavaScript web scraping refers to the process of extracting data from websites using JavaScript. It involves writing scripts that simulate human interaction with a web page, allowing you to retrieve specific information such as text, images, or other content. This data can then be processed, analyzed, or used for various purposes like data mining, research, or automation. Web scraping with JavaScript often involves using libraries such as Cheerio, Puppeteer, or jsdom, which facilitate the retrieval and manipulation of web page data. However, it is essential to be aware of legal and ethical considerations, as web scraping can potentially violate a website's terms of service or copyright laws.
