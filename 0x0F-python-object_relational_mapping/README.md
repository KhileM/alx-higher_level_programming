Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with relational databases using Python objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. ORM frameworks, like SQLAlchemy and Django's ORM, provide a higher-level, object-oriented abstraction over the database, making it easier to work with database records and relationships.

Key features of Python ORM:

1. **Object-Oriented Approach:** ORM maps database tables to Python classes, where each instance of a class corresponds to a row in the database table.

2. **Abstraction of SQL:** Developers can perform database operations (e.g., querying, inserting, updating, deleting) using Python methods and syntax, abstracting the underlying SQL.

3. **Database Portability:** ORM frameworks often support multiple database systems, allowing you to switch between them without major code changes.

4. **Relationship Management:** ORM handles relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) by using Python object attributes and methods, simplifying complex database operations.

5. **Data Validation:** ORM frameworks often include data validation and type checking, helping to maintain data integrity.

6. **Security:** ORM helps prevent SQL injection attacks by automatically escaping and sanitizing input data.

Overall, Python ORM simplifies database interaction, reduces the need for writing SQL queries, and provides a more Pythonic way to work with databases in your applications.
